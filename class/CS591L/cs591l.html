<blockquote><p>
In recent years, crimes against children and the cases of missing children have been increased at a high rate. Therefore, there's an urgent need for safety support systems to prevent crimes against children or for anti-loss, especially when the parents or guardians are not around with the children, such as the children on their ways to and back from schools. In this project, based on the children's location histories reported by the smart devices (which can be simulated by smartphones) the children wear, you are asked to explore the children's life patterns which capture their general life styles and regularities, and apply data mining and/or big data modeling techniques to learn the safe regions as well as safe routes of the children. When the children are under potential dangers (such as staying at a strange region or violate the safe routes), their parents or guardians will receive automatic notifications. You are also asked to further explore an effective energy-efficient positioning scheme for the smart devices which leverages the location tracking accuracy of the children while keeping energy overhead low.
<ul>
<li>You should collect the data by your own developed mobile application.
</li>
<li>You may need to propose and develop your own solution (substantial novel algorithm) to learn the safe regions as well as safe routes of the children based on their location history and detect potential dangers (you can take yourselves as the children and collect your own location history for learning and prediction).  Theoretical analysis and implementation are also expected.
</li>
<li>A thorough empirical evaluation using the given data set and comparing with baseline methods are required.
</li>
<li>Then, a fully developed project report with required format above should be submitted.
</li>
<li>Finally, present your project in the class.
